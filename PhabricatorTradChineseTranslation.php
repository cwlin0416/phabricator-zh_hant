  'When a user types their LDAP username and password into Phabricator, Phabricator can either bind to LDAP with those credentials directly (which is simpler, but not as powerful) or bind to LDAP with anonymous credentials, then search for record matching the supplied credentials (which is more complicated, but more powerful).

For many installs, direct binding is sufficient. However, you may want to search first if:

  - You want users to be able to log in with either their username     or their email address.
  - The login/username is not part of the distinguished name in     your LDAP records.
  - You want to restrict logins to a subset of users (like only     those in certain departments).
  - Your LDAP server is configured in some other way that prevents     direct binding from working correctly.

**To bind directly**, enter the LDAP attribute corresponding to the login name into the **Search Attributes** box below. Often, this is something like `sn` or `uid`. This is the simplest configuration, but will only work if the username is part of the distinguished name, and won\'t let you apply complex restrictions to logins.

  lang=text,name=Simple Direct Binding
  sn

**To search first**, provide an anonymous username and password below (or check the **Always Search** checkbox), then enter one or more search queries into this field, one per line. After binding, these queries will be used to identify the record associated with the login name the user typed.

Searches will be tried in order until a matching record is found. Each query can be a simple attribute name (like `sn` or `mail`), which will search for a matching record, or it can be a complex query that uses the string `${login}` to represent the login name.

A common simple configuration is just an attribute name, like `sn`, which will work the same way direct binding works:

  lang=text,name=Simple Example
  sn

A slightly more complex configuration might let the user log in with either their login name or email address:

  lang=text,name=Match Several Attributes
  mail
  sn

If your LDAP directory is more complex, or you want to perform sophisticated filtering, you can use more complex queries. Depending on your directory structure, this example might allow users to log in with either their email address or username, but only if they\'re in specific departments:

  lang=text,name=Complex Example
  (&(mail=${login})(|(departmentNumber=1)(departmentNumber=2)))
  (&(sn=${login})(|(departmentNumber=1)(departmentNumber=2)))

All of the attribute names used here are just examples: your LDAP server may use different attribute names.' => '當使用者輸入其 LDAP 帳號及密碼到 Phabricator 時，Phabricator 可直接使用這個憑證連線到 LDAP (較簡單但功能較弱) 或使用匿名憑證連線到 LDAP 搜尋與提供資料符合的記錄 (較複雜但功能較強)。

對於大多數情況，直接連線便已足夠，然而以下這些情況您可能會想要先搜尋資料：

  - 您想要讓使用者能夠使用其使用者名稱或其電子郵件位址登入。
  - 登入/使用者名稱並非 LDAP 記錄辨識名稱 (DN) 的一部份。
  - 您想要限制只有一部份的使用者能夠登入 (例如只允許在某個部門中的使用者)。
  - 您的 LDAP 伺服器被設定成使用直接連線無法正常運作的模式。

**要直接連線** 可輸入與登入名稱對應的 LDAP 屬性至下方 **搜尋屬性** 輸入框，通常這個值會是 `sn` 或 `uid`。這是最簡單的設定方式，但只有在使用者名稱是辨識名稱的一部份時才可用，且無法讓您在登入使用較複雜的限制規則。

  lang=text,name=簡單直接連線
  sn

**要先搜尋** 需於下方提供匿名使用者名稱與密碼 (或勾選 **永遠搜尋** 核選方塊) 然後輸入一個或多個查詢條件到此欄位，一個條件一行。在連線之後會使用這些條件來辨識與使用者輸入的登入名稱相關的記錄。

會依序使用查詢條件直到找到符合的記錄，每個查詢條件可以是一個簡單的屬性名稱 (例如 `sn` 或 `mail`)，這會搜尋與該屬性相符的記錄，或者是一個複雜的條件，會使用 `${login}` 字串來代表登入名稱。

常見簡單的設定只需要一個屬性名稱，如 `sn`，會與直接連線運作的方式相同：

  lang=text,name=簡單範例
  sn

再複雜一點的設定可讓使用者用其登入名稱或電子郵件位址登入：

  lang=text,name=符合多個屬性
  mail
  sn

若您的 LDAP 目錄結構較複雜，或者您想要執行較複雜的篩選，您可以使用更複雜的查詢條件。依您的目錄結構而定，這個範例可讓指定部門的使用者用其電子郵件位址或使用者名稱登入：

  lang=text,name=複雜範例
  (&(mail=${login})(|(departmentNumber=1)(departmentNumber=2)))
  (&(sn=${login})(|(departmentNumber=1)(departmentNumber=2)))

  'On database host "%s", the global "sql_mode" setting does not include the "STRICT_ALL_TABLES" mode. Enabling this mode is recommended to generally improve how MySQL handles certain errors.

Without this mode enabled, MySQL will silently ignore some error conditions, including inserts which attempt to store more data in a column than actually fits. This behavior is usually undesirable and can lead to data corruption (by truncating multibyte characters in the middle), data loss (by discarding the data which does not fit into the column), or security concerns (for example, by truncating keys or credentials).

Phabricator is developed and tested in "STRICT_ALL_TABLES" mode so you should normally never encounter these situations, but may run into them if you interact with the database directly, run third-party code, develop extensions, or just encounter a bug in the software.

Enabling "STRICT_ALL_TABLES" makes MySQL raise an explicit error if one of these unusual situations does occur. This is a safer behavior and prevents these situations from causing secret, subtle, and potentially serious issues later on.

You can find more information about this mode (and how to configure it) in the MySQL manual. Usually, it is sufficient to add this to your "my.cnf" file (in the "[mysqld]" section) and then restart "mysqld":

%s
Note that if you run other applications against the same database, they may not work in strict mode.

If you can not or do not want to enable "STRICT_ALL_TABLES", you can safely ignore this warning. Phabricator will work correctly with this mode enabled or disabled.' => '於資料庫主機 "%s" 全域的 "sql_mode" 設定並未含有 "STRICT_ALL_TABLES" 模式，建議開啟此模式來整體提升 MySQL 處理特定錯誤的能力。

Phabricator 的開發與測試均使用 "STRICT_ALL_TABLES" 模式，所以您應不會遇到任何類似的情況，但若您直接操作資料庫、執行第三方程式碼、開發擴充套件或是遇到軟體內的臭蟲仍有可能發生相關的問題。

開啟 "STRICT_ALL_TABLES" 會讓 MySQL 在不正常的情形發生時，發出明確的錯誤訊息。此是一個較保險且可避免遇到微小但可能對未來造成嚴重問題的狀況。

您可以在 MySQL 手冊中查詢到更多有關此模式的資訊 (包含如何設定)，只要將此設定加入至您的 "my.cnf" 檔案 (於 "[mysqld]" 的部份) 然後重新啟動 "mysqld" 便可:

if you are migrating to new hardware, you could perform a test migration first
with this flag set, make sure things work, and then do a production cutover

However, if a request takes a very long time to return, some components (like Apache, nginx, or PHP itself) may abort the request before it finishes. This can prevent you from using profiling tools to understand page performance in detail.

In these cases, you can use this option to force the page to abort after a smaller number of seconds (for example, 10), and dump a useful stack trace. This can provide useful information about why a page is hanging.

To use this option, set it to a small number (like 10), and reload a hanging page. The page should exit after 10 seconds and give you a stack trace.

Sending Messages
================
If you run external builds, you can use this method to publish build results back into Harbormaster after the external system finishes work or as it makes progress.

The simplest way to use this method is to call it once after the build finishes with a `pass` or `fail` message. This will record the build result, and continue the next step in the build if the build was waiting for a result.

When you send a status message about a build target, you can optionally include detailed `lint` or `unit` results alongside the message. See below for details.

If you want to report intermediate results but a build hasn\'t completed yet, you can use the `work` message. This message doesn\'t have any direct effects, but allows you to send additional data to update the progress of the build target. The target will continue waiting for a completion message, but the UI will update to show the progress which has been made.

Message Types
=============
When you send Harbormaster a message, you must include a `type`, which describes the overall state of the build. For example, use `pass` to tell Harbormaster that a build completed successfully.

Supported message types are:

%s

Unit Results
============
You can report test results alongside a message. The simplest way to do this is to report all the results alongside a `pass` or `fail` message, but you can also send a `work` message to report intermediate results.

To provide unit test results, pass a list of results in the `unit` parameter. Each result should be a dictionary with these keys:

%s

The `result` parameter recognizes these test results:

%s

This is a simple, valid value for the `unit` parameter. It reports one passing test and one failing test:



```lang=json
%s```

Lint Results
============
Like unit test results, you can report lint results alongside a message. The `lint` parameter should contain results as a list of dictionaries with these keys:

%s

The `severity` parameter recognizes these severity levels:

%s

This is a simple, valid value for the `lint` parameter. It reports one error and one warning:

```lang=json
%s```

If you want to promote revisions out of "Draft" before builds pass, or promote revisions even when builds fail, you can change the promotion behavior. This may be useful if you have very long-running builds, or some builds which are not very important.

  'After configuring Phabricator to process inbound mail, you can interact with objects (like tasks and revisions) over email. For information on configuring Phabricator, see **[[ %s | Configuring Inbound Email ]]**.

In most cases, you can reply to email you receive from Phabricator to leave comments. You can also use **mail commands** to take a greater range of actions (like claiming a task or requesting changes to a revision) without needing to log in to the web UI.

Mail commands are keywords which start with an exclamation point, like `!claim`. Some commands may take parameters, like `!assign alincoln`.

To use mail commands, write one command per line at the beginning or end of your mail message. For example, you could write this in a reply to task email to claim the task:

```
!claim

I\'ll take care of this.
```


When Phabricator receives your mail, it will process any commands first, then post the remaining message body as a comment. You can execute multiple commands at once:

```
!assign alincoln
!close

I just talked to @alincoln, and he showed me that he fixed this.

  '**Why do bot accounts need an email address?**

Although bots do not normally receive email from Phabricator, they can interact with other systems which require an email address. Examples include:

  - If the account takes actions which //send// email, we need     an address to use in the //From// header.
  - If the account creates commits, Git and Mercurial require     an email address for authorship.
  - If you send email //to// Phabricator on behalf of the     account, the address can identify the sender.
  - Some internal authentication functions depend on accounts     having an email address.


The address will automatically be verified, so you do not need to be able to receive mail at this address, and can enter some invalid or nonexistent (but correctly formatted) address like `bot@yourcompany.com` if you prefer.' => '**為何機器人帳號需要電子郵件位址?**

雖然機器人一般不會接受到來自 Phabricator 的郵件，但會與其他需要電子郵件位址的系統互動，例如：

  - 若這個帳號做的動作會 //發送// 郵件，我們會需要使用郵件位址來填寫 //寄件者// 標頭。
  - 若這個帳號建立了提交，Git 與 Mercurial 會需要郵件位址來記錄作者。

Generally, requesting more information means the query executes more slowly

  'Queries are limited to returning 100 results at a time. If you want fewer
results than this, you can use `limit` to specify a smaller limit.

If you want more results, you\'ll need to make additional queries to retrieve
more pages of results.

The result structure contains a `cursor` key with information you\'ll need in
order to fetch the next page of results. After an initial query, it will
usually look something like this:

```lang=json, name="Example Cursor Result"
{
  ...
  "cursor": {
    "limit": 100,
    "after": "1234",
    "before": null,
    "order": null
  }
  ...
}
```

The `limit` and `order` fields are describing the effective limit and order the
query was executed with, and are usually not of much interest. The `after` and
`before` fields give you cursors which you can pass when making another API
call in order to get the next (or previous) page of results.

To get the next page of results, repeat your API call with all the same
parameters as the original call, but pass the `after` cursor you received from
the first call in the `after` parameter when making the second call.

If you do things correctly, you should get the second page of results, and
a cursor structure like this:

```lang=json, name="Second Result Page"
{
  ...
  "cursor": {
    "limit": 5,
    "after": "4567",
    "before": "7890",
    "order": null
  }
  ...
}
```

You can now continue to the third page of results by passing the new `after`
cursor to the `after` parameter in your third call, or return to the previous
page of results by passing the `before` cursor to the `before` parameter. This
might be useful if you are rendering a web UI for a user and want to provide
"Next Page" and "Previous Page" links.

If `after` is `null`, there is no next page of results available. Likewise,

will be applied first as a starting point, then any additional values in
`constraints` will be applied, overwriting the defaults from the original query.

Different endpoints support different constraints. The constraints this method
supports are detailed below. As an example, you might specify constraints like
this:

```lang=json, name="Example Custom Constraints"

    "authorPHIDs": ["PHID-USER-1111", "PHID-USER-2222"],

it like this:

The table below shows the keys to use to select builtin queries and your

  'When an object (like a task) is edited, Phabricator creates a "transaction"
and applies it. This list of transactions on each object is the basis for
essentially all edits and comments in Phabricator. Reviewing the transaction
record allows you to see who edited an object, when, and how their edit changed
things.

One common reason to call this method is that you\'re implmenting a webhook and
just received a notification that an object has changed. See the Webhooks
documentation for more detailed discussion of this use case.

One Object Type at a Time
=========================

This API method can query transactions for any type of object which supports
transactions, but only one type of object can be queried per call. For example:
you can retrieve transactions affecting Tasks, or you can retrieve transactions
affecting Revisions, but a single call can not retrieve both.

This is a technical limitation arising because (among other reasons) there is
no global ordering on transactions.

To find transactions for a specific object (like a particular task), pass the
object PHID or an appropriate object identifier (like `T123`) as an
`objectIdentifier`.

To find all transactions for an object type, pass the object type constant as
an `objectType`. For example, the correct identifier for tasks is `TASK`. (You
can quickly find an unknown type constant by looking at the PHID of an object
of that type.)

Constraints
===========

These constraints are supported:

  - `phids` //Optional list<phid>.// Find specific transactions by PHID. This
    is most likely to be useful if you\'re responding to a webhook notification
    and want to inspect only the related events.
  - `authorPHIDs` //Optional list<phid>.// Find transactions with particular
    authors.

Transaction Format
==================

Each transaction has custom data describing what the transaction did. The
format varies from transaction to transaction. The easiest way to figure out
exactly what a particular transaction looks like is to make the associated kind
of edit to a test object, then query that object.

Not all transactions have data: by default, transactions have a `null` "type"
and no additional data. This API does not expose raw transaction data because
some of it is internal, oddly named, misspelled, confusing, not useful, or
could create security or policy problems to expose directly.

New transactions are exposed (with correctly spelled, comprehensible types and
useful, reasonable fields) as we become aware of use cases for them.

  'When a user types their LDAP username and password into Phabricator, Phabricator can either bind to LDAP with those credentials directly (which is simpler, but not as powerful) or bind to LDAP with anonymous credentials, then search for record matching the supplied credentials (which is more complicated, but more powerful).

For many installs, direct binding is sufficient. However, you may want to search first if:

  - You want users to be able to login with either their username     or their email address.
  - The login/username is not part of the distinguished name in     your LDAP records.
  - You want to restrict logins to a subset of users (like only     those in certain departments).
  - Your LDAP server is configured in some other way that prevents     direct binding from working correctly.

**To bind directly**, enter the LDAP attribute corresponding to the login name into the **Search Attributes** box below. Often, this is something like `sn` or `uid`. This is the simplest configuration, but will only work if the username is part of the distinguished name, and won\'t let you apply complex restrictions to logins.

  lang=text,name=Simple Direct Binding
  sn

**To search first**, provide an anonymous username and password below (or check the **Always Search** checkbox), then enter one or more search queries into this field, one per line. After binding, these queries will be used to identify the record associated with the login name the user typed.

Searches will be tried in order until a matching record is found. Each query can be a simple attribute name (like `sn` or `mail`), which will search for a matching record, or it can be a complex query that uses the string `${login}` to represent the login name.

A common simple configuration is just an attribute name, like `sn`, which will work the same way direct binding works:

  lang=text,name=Simple Example
  sn

A slightly more complex configuration might let the user login with either their login name or email address:

  lang=text,name=Match Several Attributes
  mail
  sn

If your LDAP directory is more complex, or you want to perform sophisticated filtering, you can use more complex queries. Depending on your directory structure, this example might allow users to login with either their email address or username, but only if they\'re in specific departments:

  lang=text,name=Complex Example
  (&(mail=${login})(|(departmentNumber=1)(departmentNumber=2)))
  (&(sn=${login})(|(departmentNumber=1)(departmentNumber=2)))

All of the attribute names used here are just examples: your LDAP server may use different attribute names.' => '當使用者輸入其 LDAP 帳號及密碼到 Phabricator 時，Phabricator 可直接使用這個憑證連線到 LDAP (較簡單但功能較弱) 或使用匿名憑證連線到 LDAP 搜尋與提供資料符合的記錄 (較複雜但功能較強)。

對於大多數情況，直接連線便已足夠，然而以下這些情況您可能會想要先搜尋資料：

  - 您想要讓使用者能夠使用其使用者名稱或其電子郵件位址登入。
  - 登入/使用者名稱並非 LDAP 記錄辨識名稱 (DN) 的一部份。
  - 您想要限制只有一部份的使用者能夠登入 (例如只允許在某個部門中的使用者)。
  - 您的 LDAP 伺服器被設定成使用直接連線無法正常運作的模式。

**要直接連線** 可輸入與登入名稱對應的 LDAP 屬性至下方 **搜尋屬性** 輸入框，通常這個值會是 `sn` 或 `uid`。這是最簡單的設定方式，但只有在使用者名稱是辨識名稱的一部份時才可用，且無法讓您在登入使用較複雜的限制規則。

  lang=text,name=簡單直接連線
  sn

**要先搜尋** 需於下方提供匿名使用者名稱與密碼 (或勾選 **永遠搜尋** 核選方塊) 然後輸入一個或多個查詢條件到此欄位，一個條件一行。在連線之後會使用這些條件來辨識與使用者輸入的登入名稱相關的記錄。

會依序使用查詢條件直到找到符合的記錄，每個查詢條件可以是一個簡單的屬性名稱 (例如 `sn` 或 `mail`)，這會搜尋與該屬性相符的記錄，或者是一個複雜的條件，會使用 `${login}` 字串來代表登入名稱。

常見簡單的設定只需要一個屬性名稱，如 `sn`，會與直接連線運作的方式相同：

  lang=text,name=簡單範例
  sn

再複雜一點的設定可讓使用者用其登入名稱或電子郵件位址登入：

  lang=text,name=符合多個屬性
  mail
  sn

若您的 LDAP 目錄結構較複雜，或者您想要執行較複雜的篩選，您可以使用更複雜的查詢條件。依您的目錄結構而定，這個範例可讓指定部門的使用者用其電子郵件位址或使用者名稱登入：

  lang=text,name=複雜範例
  (&(mail=${login})(|(departmentNumber=1)(departmentNumber=2)))
  (&(sn=${login})(|(departmentNumber=1)(departmentNumber=2)))

所有上述使用的屬性名稱只是範例：您的 LDAP 伺服器可能使用其他的屬性名稱。',
